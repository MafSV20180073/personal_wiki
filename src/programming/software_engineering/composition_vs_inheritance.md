# Composition Vs. Inheritance

***
## Five reasons to use composition over inheritance in Java and OOP:

1. Java doesn't support multiple inheritance;
2. Composition offers better test-ability of a class than inheritance;
3. Many OOP design patterns favors composition over inheritance;
4. Though both composition and inheritance allows code reusage, one of the disadvantages of inheritance is that it breaks encapsulation;
   - When behavior of super class changes, functionaloty in subclass may get broken, without any change on its part;
5. Composition is more flexible than inheritance.
