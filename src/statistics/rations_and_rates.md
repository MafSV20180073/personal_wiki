# Ratios and Rates

***

**Ratio** - relationship/comparison of two quantities or measures:

- It is the proportion of one thing to another
- It is the comparison of numbers with the same units
- It explains the correlation of one thing to another

<br>

**Rate** - comparison of two quantities which can have different units:

- Refers to the frequency by which a certain event happens
- Refers to the fixed quantity of two things

(“Rate is the amount by which a single quantity changes with respect to one or
more other quantities.”)

***

While a rate only refers to the fixed quantity of two things, a ratio refers to the relationship between several things. A rate also refers to the changes in measuraments or units while a ratio also refers to the difference between things.

**Dummy example:**

```
"Sarah has five chocolate bars, and she can eat all of them in one minute.
Joan has ten chocolate bars, and she can eat all of them in one minute.” 

- The rate by which Sarah eats her chocolate bars is 5 bars/minute; 
- Joan’s rate is 10 bars/minute. 

The ratio between Sarah’s chocolate bars to Joan’s is 5:10
```
